## Overview

This repository is related to the _RegBL (RBD/GWR/RegBL) completion_ research project. The _STDL_ was contacted by the Swiss Federal Statistical Office (_OFS_) to determine in which extend it could be possible to complete the construction date of Swiss buildings based on the analysis of a temporal sequence of the Swiss federal maps produced by _swisstopo_. With an initial target of _80%_ of correct guesses, the goal of this research project was to demonstrate the possibility to reach such goal using a reliable validation metric.

Intyearpolator is, as its name suggests, a spatial interpolator designed for predicting years of a random field.

# intYEARpolator
This predictor was especially designed for infering the year of construction of buildings in Switzerland. Although this is supplementary to an object detection based algorithm working on the presence (or absence) of houses in swisstopo maps in comparison to RegBL (GWR) database. Therefere, this model is only extrapolating regbl-poc predictions to years beyond the oldest map available in some area. This is an add-on and should not replace the results from the main detector. Although you may find it interesting for testing, as its predictions are made for all null (NaN) values. Despite it's been desgned for spatially interpolating the year of construction of houses, it may also be interesting in cases where the urban pattern structure could be relevant.

IntYEARpolator is a spatial statistcs model which main characteristics are to query for neighbour's data based on different searching radius and the use of a gaussian mixture model for clustering in estimations. First of all, a general searching radius is defined as half of the largest distance (between random variables). For every prediction location, the variance between all data in the 'prior' searching radius will be used to create a 'posterior' searching radius. This way, the higher the variance, the smaller the searching radius, as we tend to trust data less. The exception to this rule is for variances that are higher than 2 x the mean distance between points. In this case, the searching radius increases again in order to avoid clusters of very old houses that during tests caused understimation. The figure below demonstrates the logic behing the creation of buffers.

being *d* the distance between points, $$\mu$$ the mean and sÂ² the sample variance. 

This first procdure is used to fill the gaps in the entry database. This completion is only done in the random variable column and not on the coordinates on. This is done so clustering can be computed. The unsupervised learning tool used is a gaussian mixture model, which does not only segments data into clusters, but as it is a probabilitical model, it wiull indicate the prbability of each point belonging to every cluster. The number of components computed is a linear function to the total number of points being used, inclusing the ones that previously had gaps. The function to find the number of component is the following:

$$n_c=0.02*n_p-56$$ 

being $n_c$ the number of components / clusters, and $n_p$ the total number of points used.

Hence the matrix of probabilities of every point belonging to each cluster is then multiplied by the the mean of each cluster (A = $\lambda * m_c$, being $\lambda$ the matrix of what can be consideres weighs and $m_c$ the mean of clusters matrix), as in the example below.



# Usage

There are two input files called in the prompt, being one a table of the outputs of regbl-poc detector (deduce_location folder), once **compacted**, and the other the entire regbl database. The output for is a table adding **predicted year** and **prediction variance**. The second one was majorly thought for evaluation of the searching radiuses creation. An optional input refers to creating a plo tof the clusters performed or not with the **plot** argument, that can be assigned as 1 (True), or 0(False, default).

In your terminal, try:

```
$python3 intyearpolator.py -i /path/to/deduce_compacted_table -r /path/to/RegBL/GWR_database - /path/to/output/predictions
```
