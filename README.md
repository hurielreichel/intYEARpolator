# intYEARpolator
Intyearpolator is, as its name suggests, a spatial interpolator designed for predicting years of a random field. 

# Overview
This predictor was especially designed for predicting the year of construction of buildings in Switzerland. Although this is supplementary to an object detection based algorithm working on the presence (or absence) of houses in swisstopo maps in comparison to RegBL (GWR) database. Therefere, this model is only extrapolating regbl-poc (https://github.com/swiss-territorial-data-lab/regbl-poc) predictions to years beyond the oldest map available in some area.
